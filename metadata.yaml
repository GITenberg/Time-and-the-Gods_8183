description: "Time and the Gods is the second book by Irish fantasy writer Lord Dunsany,\
  \ considered a major influence on the work of J. R. R. Tolkien, H. P. Lovecraft,\
  \ Ursula K. Le Guin and others.\nThe book was first published in hardcover by William\
  \ Heinemann in September, 1906, and has been reprinted a number of times since.\
  \ It was issued by the Modern Library in an unauthorised combined edition with The\
  \ Book of Wonder under the latter's title in 1918.\nDunsany had a brief preface\
  \ in the original edition and added a new introduction to the 1922 edition.\nThe\
  \ book is a series of short stories linked by Dunsany's invented pantheon of deities\
  \ who dwell in Pegāna. It was preceded by his earlier collection The Gods of Pegāna\
  \ and followed by some stories in The Sword of Welleran and Other Stories.\nThe\
  \ book was illustrated by Dunsany's preferred artist Sidney Sime, who provided a\
  \ range of black and white plates, the originals of which are still at Dunsany Castle.\
  \ These were present in the 1906 and 1922 editions, not in the unauthorised collections\
  \ and not in most modern reproductions.\nThe title is thought to have been influenced\
  \ by Algernon Swinburne, who wrote the line \"Time and the Gods are at strife\"\
  \ in his 1866 poem “Hymn to Proserpine.”\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
